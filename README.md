As from the task, I perceived that we need to make two page website where first page will contain all the blogs and the second page will contain the specific blog details. we can anvigate to any particular blog by clicking
on the blog on home page.
So I make a file which contains static data about blogs which will be showed in the website.
I have used React.js and CSS to design the website. 
After reading a blog , you can upvote/like the blog. The upvotes will be shown in the home page along with the blog also.
